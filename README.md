# MultiThreading
**Producer and Consumer Problem**
  The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic example of a multi-threading problem where synchronization between threads is required. It involves two types of threads:).<br/>
  <br/>
    1.**Producer**: This thread generates data (or items) and adds it to a shared resource (like a buffer or queue).<br/>
    2. **Consumer**: This thread consumes the data produced by the producer from the shared resource.).<br/>
    </br>
    **The challenge is to ensure that producers do not produce more data than the consumer can consume (i.e., the buffer should not overflow), and consumers do not consume data that isn't yet produced (i.e., the buffer should not underflow). Proper synchronization is needed to prevent race conditions, where multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously in a way that leads to unexpected results.**<br/>
<br/>
    **Key Concepts**<br/>
  **_Buffer (or Queue)_:** A shared resource where the producer places items, and the consumer takes items from.<br/>
  **_Synchronization_:** Mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or conditions are used to ensure that producers and consumers do not interfere with each other.<br/>
  **_Blocking_:** If the buffer is full, the producer should wait until there is space. If the buffer is empty, the consumer should wait until there are items to consume.<br/>
